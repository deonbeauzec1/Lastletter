      <p><strong>To those who have harmed me</strong>, I leave all my worldly forgiveness. For the harm they gave me was mine to bear, and I wish for it to be buried with me. I do not want to take any grudges with me either.</p>

      <p><strong>To my family</strong> I leave the words unspoken. The things you wish I would have said aloud. The things I did say, I only regret, for they fell on ears unwilling to listen. My bravery is extinguished. My fire is embers.</p>

      <p><strong>To those that I had the honour of loving</strong>. To you I leave responsibility. With the awareness of how selfish I am being. I ask the most—keep alive the memories we shared in your heart. Feed them and water them. Let them bloom into even better ones in new places with new people. Bring joy into this cruel world. Leave the pain, the fights and the sorrow with me. I can carry it away now. I truly believe I was built to be alone on this planet, but I resisted as long as I could. I am truly sorry. Do not mourn me. What I want for you is joy. And love. And a long, happy life.</p>

      <p class="signature">—Deon</p>

      <p><strong>P.S.</strong> One of my favorite things I ever wrote:</p>

      <blockquote>
We lived there. We loved there. The smoke choked out my family. They were dead before the fire ever touched them. A mercy for some. A torturous mercy. Calmly words drifted into our community. Suggestions and knowledge. Research and propaganda. They dare not drift with filters. They drift with targeted precision. They move slowly and wistfully, with unspecific intentions to outsiders, but clear and precise effects. The intention does not determine the path, only the end. 

We knew where the fire started, only afterwards though. In the moment, we assumed it was where the screams shouted. But that is not necessarily the truth. The screams did coalesce in the moment. They flowed together, individuals, people, reduced to a symphony of sorrows. Oh what a core feature it is, to scream, to panic in pain. Oh how human it is to lose sanity in cries of pain. How horribly human. 
If you could perceive, for a moment, how much pain surrounds you – Be honest – Would You Poke Your Own Eyes Out With A Blunt Knife? Or would you keep moving with eyes filled with pain and wait for the numbness, the expected horrid acceptance, to surround you, to move inside on one deep breath and rest within your lungs? The problem with the latter is that you will not be a closed vessel, we humans seldom are, you will become a boiling cauldron, you will boil and spew your toxic smoke to all who dare trod near you. You will be no passive bystander. 
	What is a passive bystander? How can this be a person? A disconnection. It is an anomaly. For there is no passivity in the cases of humans. But how to process this? How to investigate without the self-inhibiting guilt that it so easily brings to the slightly self-aware. For if there is no passivity, there is not neutral, because there cannot be neutral, then anything other than the right side is cruelty. How can we then be sure to have chosen the right one. What inside us is a true compass, unaffected by the electrical pulses inside our minds, unaffected by the magnetic personalities so commonly possessed by those with evil intentions? And if we are so easily affected by these magnetic personalities, then are you passive when influenced, or cruel by association? Surely, we cannot excuse these weak internal (MORAL) compasses? A compass does not kill. A COMPASS DOES NOT KILL. But people do. And flowery language and metaphors are most likely the most powerful weapons known. For sticks, stones may hurt, but words will genocide me. 
A question of complacency, or a question of participation? How to differentiate. How to stop asking questions? Is it a technique to absolve? Am I trying to impose my own thoughts and insecurities on you? Am I the cauldron? 

We could find where the fire started afterwards. Some bodies were pristine. Their sleep uninterrupted. Staying uninterrupted. Some were strewn over others, some were panicked. Some had torn into their necks as their lungs yearned for one more molecule of oxygen. Or physiologically, for four. Some, some corpses, some people, had the results of licking flames. They had flesh melted. Flesh caramelized. Sacks of meat on the floor, cooking. My mother was one. My mother was cooking. And some, the first, their bodies were charred. Blackened coal. Unrecognisable as anything living. The vision of biblical punishment. Corpses crumbling at a touch. 
And then the start? The epicentre is there, the first affected. We know the first victims of the flame. We do not know where it started. A strange situation. Where does a fire start? 

Where does a fire start?

A fire starts where combustion started i.e. A Carbon + O2 = CO2 + H2O + HEAT. 
A fire starts when you light a match. 
A fire starts when you decide you want to burn someone. 
A fire starts when you chop down a tree. 
A fire starts when you plant the seed. 
A fire starts when you plant the seed. 
A fire starts when you think of a fire. A fire starts when the thought of a fire first occurs. 
A fire starts when someone thinks of it, and there is no one nearby with the thought to extinguish it. 

How does a fire spread?

Wildly. 

And when it spread there is no way to stop it. There exists ways, they are written and explained and studied so meticulously that people keep burning to death. And we keep watching it happen, assured that it will never happen again, assured that this tragedy happened once. It was a horrible thing, but what a worse thing it is to dwell on a topic. 
What a shame it was, the thousands dead, and now, the weather. 

And the photos! The recounting of the occurrence does NOT include the photos of the coal black corpses strewn across and within charred possessions in a way that makes it physically impossible to discern where the back stops and the couch starts. Those photos have been lost to history, OLD NEWS. They were the catchy headlines. They were the covers. Our memorials, they include the green re-emerging grass. 
Look, the fire can destroy so much, but it cannot destroy our human spirit. 
A joke. A pathetic fucking joke. An unfunny catastrophe of a joke. 
The human spirits were destroyed when they were screaming in agonising pain, when their flesh was melting from their hands onto doorknobs as they tried to escape the hell that had suddenly emerged in their lives. That is where the human spirits were destroyed. And THAT IS WHERE YOU LEFT THEM. And it is convenient for you to forget, to collectively drive amnesia, so that we can heal together. You do not care about our healing, you want to keep us complacent. You want to absolve your sins. Your only confessional is to yourself. Which is fitting. You are the priest. You only believe in yourselves. But you try to force us to believe as well. 

 And now, now we sit where they used to. We start again. We build and we build. While you prosper on yesterdays’ building once more. You do not have to work. You did not wake up today and put up the new walls to protect yourselves. You sit comfortably. 
But you sneer. You also jeer. You wrinkle your ugly fucking noses at us while we build on top of the graves containing the charred remains of our families and the furniture they crumbled or melted onto. And you look at the GRASS. You marvel at how wonderful the signs are. How nature can always rebuild from the ashes. 
And we know this, but you don’t. And you keep whistling your messages aloud. You leave your messages and they drip like poison. They tell us about us. And more importantly, they tell You about us, from You. You are the only ones that get a word in. 

Your words fall onto ready kindling. We are tired from building every day. We are tired of starting every time. But you, you cannot get tired because you have nothing to do but entertain yourselves. Your stolen advantages (taking advantage) do not satisfy you, because they were taken by ancestors, from ancestors. So you rest again. And you look for something to do. You become weak and bored. Until you become worried. Until you see that we get to rest for once. That is when you start working. 
Your work is not like my work. My work does not fester and rot inside the fresh cuts of those preparing meals to feed their children. My work does not blow onto the embers, watching the smoke, watching the fibres light up as the heat spreads. My work does not start fires. Your work is not to start fires, but without starting fires, your work would be nothing. Because the field was never even. You were running downhill. You were laughing as they caught up. And you reached the finish line together. A photo finish. If there was only a photo of your decrepit face at the finish line as you drew. But I always win. You said this, this movie-ready line, you actually said this. You were running downhill, they weren’t. And you still couldn’t win. Your muscles withered from relaxation, you did not realise you would need to race again some day. 

And because you drew. Because your gap was decreasing. Because you could no longer win by doing absolutely FUCK-ALL, you sent the sparks. Your propaganda started. Your tired messages. Your lazy writing and overused metaphors.
Now is not the time for innovation. 
Stick to what works kid. 
Why fix what broke them last time? 
Your sparks fly into our homes. The fires start somewhere. They always do. And at some point we should really get around to finding out where a fire starts.  We are tired of seeing how fires spread. We are tired of the burned bodies. We are tired of the bones we need to bury in the foundations of the new walls we keep building.
